# React Meals App
The React Meals App is a sample web application built using React.js. It allows users to view a list of available meals, add meals to their cart, and place orders. This README provides an overview of the project structure and components.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of React.js and JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To get started with the React Meals App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/SarahKatherineFrancis/react-meals-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd react-meals-app

3. Install the project dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm start

5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Project Structure
The project structure follows a standard React application setup:

src/: Contains the source code for the application.
components/: Contains React components used in the app.
assets/: Stores images, fonts, or other static assets.
store/: Manages global state using React's Context API.
App.js: The main application component.
index.js: The entry point of the application.

## Components
### 1. Modal Component
The Modal component is responsible for displaying modal dialogs with a backdrop. It uses React portals to render outside the normal component hierarchy. The modal can display any content passed as props.children.

### 2. MealsSummary Component
The MealsSummary component displays a summary of the available meals, providing a brief description of the food options.

### 3. AvailableMeals Component
The AvailableMeals component lists the available meals that users can add to their cart. It utilizes dummy meal data and the MealItem component.

### 4. MealItem Component
The MealItem component represents an individual meal item. Users can add meals to their cart using this component.

### 5. MealItemForm Component
The MealItemForm component is used within the MealItem component to handle user input for adding meals to the cart. It includes validation for the quantity of meals.

### 6. Header and HeaderCartButton Components
These components are part of the application's header and are responsible for displaying the app title and a cart icon that opens the shopping cart.

### 7. Cart and CartItem Components
These components manage the shopping cart, including displaying the cart items, their quantity, and total price.

## Usage
The React Meals App serves as a sample application for learning and exploring React.js concepts, including state management, component composition, and use of hooks.

Feel free to modify, expand, or integrate this code into your projects. You can also customize the styling by editing the CSS files in the src directory.
