## Component Overview
### Cart
The Cart component is the main shopping cart component that displays the items in the cart, handles adding and removing items, initiates the checkout process, and submits orders.

### CartIcon
The CartIcon component is a simple SVG icon representing a shopping cart. It can be used to display a cart icon in the header or navigation bar.

### CartItem
The CartItem component represents an item in the shopping cart. It displays the item's name, price, quantity, and provides buttons to remove and add items.

### Checkout
The Checkout component allows users to enter their shipping information and submit an order. It handles form validation and order submission.

### Header
The Header component displays the application's header, including the title/logo and the shopping cart icon.

### HeaderCartButton
The HeaderCartButton component displays a button with a shopping cart icon and the number of items in the cart. It also provides a highlight animation when items are added to the cart.

### AvailableMeals
The AvailableMeals component displays a list of available meals fetched from a Firebase database. It handles loading and error states while fetching data.

### Meals
The Meals component combines the MealsSummary and AvailableMeals components to display a summary of meals and the list of available meals.

### MealsSummary
The MealsSummary component displays a summary of the available meals, highlighting their quality and preparation.

### MealItem
The MealItem component represents an individual meal item that can be added to the cart. It displays the meal's name, description, and price.

### MealItemForm
The MealItemForm component provides a form for users to enter the quantity of a meal they want to add to the cart. It handles quantity validation and submission.

### cart-context.js
The cart-context.js file defines a React context for managing the shopping cart state and provides functions for adding, removing, and clearing cart items.

### CartProvider
The CartProvider component uses the cart context to manage the shopping cart state using a reducer. It provides cart-related data and functions to its child components.

## Usage
The React Meals App serves as a sample application for learning and exploring React.js concepts, including state management, component composition, and use of hooks.
